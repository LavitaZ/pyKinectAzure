# Ventilator for Human Breathing Simulation on a Lung Phantom

This repository contains code for simulating human breathing patterns using a blower controlled by an Arduino with feedback from pressure sensors. The ventilator system also tracks veritcal lung displacement using ArUco markers and a Microsoft Kinect Azure camera using the [pyKinectAzure] (https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/pyKinectAzure)https://github.com/ibaiGorordo/pyKinectAzure) interface.
